Friends:
- [PunishedFelix](https://punishedfelix.com/) has excellent work on disability, Guattari, and the politics of technology. Also the person who helped me set up this site. His [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/crazybuizel) has a lot of excellent videos, combining complicated philosophy, shitposting, disability politics, history and technology. 
- [Andrewism](https://www.youtube.com/c/Andrewism) is a thoughtful video creator and a deeply kind person. His work focuses on anarchism, and I personally really like how he ends up focusing in on parts of anarchism that are neglected -- like Black anarchism -- or long-standing but forgotten -- like youth liberation and the anarchist critiques of schooling -- or profoundly important in our current times -- like the political nature of being "Indigeneous", and how that isn't as simple as is often thought. Also his voice is top tier.

Sites I like: 
- Shawn Wilbur's [Libertarian Labyrinth](https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org) is the best site for understanding mutualism and more generally "pre-classical" anarchism.[^wilbur] Wilbur is not just the premier source on Proudhon today, but also extremely approachable. 
- Kevin Carson's work is posted on [C4SS](https://c4ss.org/content/author/kevin-carson). Carson is one of the best theorists working on anarchist economics today, and is a joy to read. His most recent book on theories of the State, was thorough and enjoyable.
- [Chuang](https://chuangcn.org) are some of the most sober modern analysts of political economy in a global context, specifically focusing on China. 
- [Crimethinc](https://crimethinc.com) has an excellent name and generally publishes solid stuff.
- Deleuze's seminars can be [found online](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/full-index/).
- [Semiotics for Beginners](http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel//Documents/S4B/semiotic.html) by Daniel Chandler is an excellent resource.


[^wilbur]: Please keep an eye out for a friendly critique of Wilbur to be posted to this site. This footnote is mostly so I remember to do it.
