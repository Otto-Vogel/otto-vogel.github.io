This is a reading list for Heterodox political economy. I have not read it all myself; in fact this has been a collaborative work with several others. See the note at the end for thanks. If you have further texts on degrowth, I would greatly appreciate them. Note as well that mutualism is a specifically anarchist philosophy.

## Some notes on the various texts:

- Veblen is seen as a positive theorist of capitalism for some, as well as he has various points where he endorses phrenology.
- Proudhon’s racism and sexism are also present in what I understand to be minor ways in his text; see Déjaques for a critique of this. If this is an incorrect assessment of how present the antisemitism and sexism are in the texts, please let me know so I can amend this note.
- Marx and Engels held to colonialist views of economics and development. Overall, a much better approach is found in *How the West Came to Rule*.
- The various anarchist economics are indeed various; I don’t think there is someone who will agree with everything put forwards by the authors in that section.
- The texts Sorghum and Steel and Red Dust by Chuang form two parts of three of their historical account of the development of capitalism within the developmental regime of China. The third part is forthcoming.
- Aufheben’s What was the USSR? is a similar, though methodologically distinct approach taken to the development of the USSR. It engages far more with various theorists of what the USSR’s economy should have been classified as.
- Bakunin’s The Capitalist System could have easily been placed in the Marxist section. That text in particular demonstrates how Bakunin agreed with Marx’s critique of capitalism, not just that he agreed. Note should be taken that Bakuinin was technically an anarchist collectivist, not an anarchist communist. Anarchist communists like Kropotkin and Malatesta actually were highly critical of Marxian economics.

From the original author:
> Thanks goes out to: Teuton and Ry for their help with Capital as Power, Anne for his help with VFT, Rosencrone and Rosenklippe for works on mutualism, Windows for his help with Camatte, Tiqqun and Fernandez, Sloth for xir’s recommendation of The Notion of Expenditure, Matryoshka for the assistance with texts on degrowth, [and] some Marxists, who shall remain anonymous because they were at least mildly insufferable, for their help expanding my non-VFT section on Marxism.
