Where applicable I will include links to the articles on the anarchist library or other online repositories. We should also remember the insights of the Invisible Committee:

> It’s up to us to organize the encounters, the circulation, the understandings, the collusions between the local consistencies. The revolutionary task has partly become a task of translation. There is no Esperanto of revolt. It’s not up to the rebels to learn to speak anarchist; it’s up to the anarchists to become polyglot.

Several authors on this list are still in prison. Mumia Abu Jamal and other comrades of ours live behind bars. Some, like Russell Maroon Shoats and Carl Harp, died there. Many, if not most, are Black. While prison gives them time to ruminate and write theory for us who work in the sun, we should not forget that we owe them freedom, and should work to get it to them.

I have modified the ordering of the list due to some disagreements between me and the original author.

## Names Without Texts

I apologize; I know their names, but works are harder to come by. When I find works I want to include above, I will. If you find texts by these comrades, be sure to send them to me via email; I’ll owe you one, for the little that’s worth.

-   Liu Zhongshi aka Ray Jones
-   Itō Noe
-   Domingos Passos

I am also working on getting some texts translated, in particular the ones from Otto Gross. If you are able to help translate German psychoanalytic texts into English, please do get in touch.
