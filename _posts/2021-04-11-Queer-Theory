Please note, I have not read all these texts. This is as much a reading list for me as for others; as such, if you want to have something added, just send me a message. As well, please look for and read texts on your own; queer anarchism and queer theory more general should not have any strict borders, anyone can write it, and everyone can benefit from it.
This will be updated as I find things, friends remind me, and I have to dig up stuff for a request.

## Basic Introductions:

- Gender by Jamie Heckert (If you only can read one, read this one. Short.)
- Gender Outlaw by Kate Bornstien. (Book)

- Refusing to wait: Anarchism and Intersectionality by Deric Shannon and J. Rogue. (Zine)
- The Trouble with Normal: Sex, Politics, and the Ethics of Queer Life by Michael Warner. (Book)
- Be Gay Do Crime by A Gang of Criminal Queers/Mary Nardini Gang. (I mean the short text here, the book is hard to find.)

## Queer History:

- Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution by David Carter. (Please note, this was written in 1993 and thus the language in this is outdated and would be considered transphobic today.) (Book)
